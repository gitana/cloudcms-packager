# cloudcms-packager

For information on the Cloud CMS Packager, please see:

https://www.cloudcms.com/documentation/bulk-import.html

Note that starting with version 1.1.0, the packager now supports Transfer Schema v3.
This is compatible with Cloud CMS version 3.2.75 and beyond.

To build archives that can be imported in an earlier version of Cloud CMS (using Transfer Schema v2), please use an earlier version of the packager.
